- **Intro**: It is not uncommon that people don't show up for medical appointments and miss their chance to receive proper treatments. Different reasons may be present such as forgetting appointments or something urgent had happened. Therefore, it would be helpful to understand the factors affecting people showing up on appointments and predict if a patient will miss their appointment or not next time. The predictions can further help medical staffs to know which patients may need extra reminders.
- **Research Question**: What are the factors that most correlate with the show-up rate of medical appointments?
- **Tech used**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, scikit-learn(LogisticRegression)
